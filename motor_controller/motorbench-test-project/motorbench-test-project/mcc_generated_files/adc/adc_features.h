This file defines the ADC module feature C-macros available 
on the selected device. The macros defined in this file provides the 
flexibility to easily migrate the user application to other device which might 
have varied feature list.

The file has to be manually included in main.c, if the user intends to migrate the
application to another device which might have varied feature list.
